# CS3035 â€“ Course Project Description

## Description of Your Project

My Project is titled "Dollar Bank" and it is a simple Bank App made with JavaFX. 
The application provides the user a multitude of functionalities that a real bank might provide.
The reason why I created this app for my individual project is that I think that a Bank App is a more unique idea that has practical use cases.

The app satisfies all the requirements of the project. 
For Example, It has a Splash Screen when starting the App, 
It has a Menu Bar that shows relevant Menu Items. 
It also contains a Help View and an About View.

The user can login as an Admin or as one of the registered Clients. 
The password for the Admin and all the Clients currently stored is "123456".
If logged in as an Admin, the User is taken to a Create Client Screen where he/she may create new clients 
and give them a Savings and Checking Account.

The application is connected with an SQLite Database that stores all Client information.

The admin can use the menu bar to navigate to other views like "Clients" view where they can view all the saved clients in the system and their details.

The Admin can also use the "Deposit" view to deposit money in any of the clients' Accounts.

If logged in as a Client, the user is taken to the Dashboard of that specific Client. 
On the Dashboard, the client user can view all the details of their account including the latest transactions, 
account balances, money earned/spent last month and also functionality to send money to another client.

The Client can use the Menu Bar to Access the 'Transactions' view where they can view all of their transactions.

The Client can also access the 'Accounts' View and view information related to all their accounts. 
They can also move money from Savings to Checking Account and vice versa.

Both Client and Admin can access the Help and About page using the Menu Bar.

Clicking on 'Application' and then 'Switch User' on the Menu Bar will logout the currently logged-in user and take them back to the Login Window.

Most of the functionality that the user can see in all the views works, except a few operations like deleting a client.

Here is a link to a video demonstration of the application:
